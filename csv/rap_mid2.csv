عربيةDear Mama Lyrics You are appreciated  When I was young me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place Suspended from school and scared to go home I was a fool with the big boys breakin all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies the same drama When things went wrong wed blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell Huggin on my mama from a jail cell And whod think in elementary hey Id see the penitentiary one day And runnin from the police thats right Mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside And even as a crack fiend Mama You always was a black queen Mama I finally understand For a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it Theres no way I can pay you back but the plan Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated You might also like Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we love ya  Now aint nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there He passed away and I didnt cry Cause my anger wouldnt let me feel for a stranger They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along I was lookin for a father he was gone I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin I needed money of my own so I started slangin I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin money in your mailbox I love payin rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you Cause when I was low you was there for me You never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you comin home after work late Youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hotplate You just workin with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin But now the road got rough youre alone Youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we love ya  Pour out some liquor and I reminisce Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that Im hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on Its a struggle every day gotta roll on And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated Sweet lady dont you know we love ya
